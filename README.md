- Render sidebar content and media (ALBERT)
- Sidebar title centering (it is not currently centered within the tab) (ALBERT)
- Add links for all metadata in sidebar (ALBERT)
- Graph aspect ratio is fucky: click any dropdown and select something, open sidebar and select something else from dropdown (keep sidebar open), then collapse sidebar (ALBERT)
- Alphabetically list items in Navbar dropdowns (ALBERT)
- ~~ Min-height the sidebar images (some of them are rendering too short) (ALBERT) ~~
- Link Artists to collab artists (ALBERT)
- Navigation filtering selectors (styling and updating node graph) (ALBERT)
- Pages: Video and about (DAVID)
- Node graph zooming (ALBERT - SECONDARY)
- Lightbox for viewing images when clicked (ALBERT - SECONDARY)

### David's notes

## To-do items

- TESTING

  - AT tables / required fields breaks all the things

- index.js page

  - the layout does not stretch to full screen on various mobile devices (maybe to do with h-screen class?)

- NodeGraph component

  - zooming
  - layout new components: zoom
  - Data appears to be rendering multiple times when clicking a node

## From VS Meeting: 5-10-2021 - Prototype Review

To-do items (so far)

- Filters will be clickable and navigable
- Zooming will work on both desktop and mobile
- Mobile layout will work for most devices
- Filter dropdowns in mobile will be functional
- ~~ Filters will list items alphabetically (DAVID) ~~
- When a node is clicked or filter selected, the sidebar will snap to the top of the scrollable area

- Zoom function
- Highlight
- ~~ Airtable bio images for artists - layout - image first (ALBERT) ~~
- ~~ Tip this artist (ALBERT) ~~
- ~~ Change Hometown field - birthplace (ALBERT) ~~

- videos are squares on desktop
- lightboxes for still images

- warehouse 21 and other partners -

  - waiting on a logo from David

- help page / link on desktop

- help modal - maybe - will wait to hear back from R and H
