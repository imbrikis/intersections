# Intersections Notes

## General Overview

- We have began developing the site for mobile first
- In Figma, use the page DEVELOPMENT for reference

### Priority Items

- Troubleshoot tutorial layout on mobile (the filter list compresses and throws off the layout of the tut, and the tut pulse icon is visible through the mobile nav menu) (DAVID)
- Format Affiliations per Hannah's specification: Would it be possible now to make the title of each org bold? and add lines after the artists too (ALBERT)

### Secondary Items

- NodeGraph component - Graph zooming (ALBERT)
- Artwork image links: images should zoom in slightly when hovered, or some animation to signify hover (ALBERT)
- Node linking: filter-linked-colored lines should stay above all other lines (ALBERT)
- Node linking: it may help to halo all child nodes, even other artists, etc (ALBERT)
- Graph aspect ratio is fucky: click any dropdown and select something, open sidebar and select something else from dropdown (keep sidebar open), then collapse sidebar (ALBERT)
