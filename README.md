# Intersections Notes

## General Overview

- We have began developing the site for mobile first
- In Figma, use the page DEVELOPMENT for reference

### Albert's notes

### David's notes

---

### Priority Items

- Create link to node graph in mobile ham menu
- Vimeo videos on Videos page will not load (ALBERT)
- Video page will not scroll down past a certain point in mobile (ALBERT)
- Add links for all metadata in sidebar - collabs not showing up on Artist (ALBERT)
- Graph aspect ratio is fucky: click any dropdown and select something, open sidebar and select something else from dropdown (keep sidebar open), then collapse sidebar (ALBERT)
- Link Artists to collab artists (ALBERT)
- When selecting Influence - History, rendered artwork images are overlapping (ALBERT)
- Lightbox for viewing images when clicked (DAVID)
- Complete the How-To page (DAVID)
- Images sometimes do not render (see Influence desc images, might only be an issue in development) (ALBERT)
- Correct the influence of gravity on artwork nodes (there is too much as of now) (ALBERT)
- Images are overlapping in Affiliations sidebar (ALBERT)
- Collaborators should be listed in artistsandartworks component, in artist sidebar if there are collaborators (ALBERT)
- Artwork image links: images should zoom in slightly when hovered, or some animation to signify hover (ALBERT)
- Node linking: filter-linked-colored lines should stay above all other lines (ALBERT)
- Node linking: it may help to halo all child nodes, even other artists, etc (ALBERT

#### from VS meeting 5-25-2021

- ~~ artist nodes not linking by collaborators (ALBERT) ~~
- Collaborators: not showing up on artists (known bug) (ALBERT)
- display collaborators on the artist node info (ALBERT)
- ~~ change display logic for artists that are only collaborators (ALBERT) ~~
- ~~ make sure videos from vimeo will work (ALBERT) ~~
- ~~ move image above description (artwork node) (ALBERT) ~~
- ~~ Title Line (Vital Spaces: Intersections) => Remove Logo Intersections (in bold) Vital Spaces, Maida, Warehouse 21 (W21) (ALBERT) ~~
- ~~ keep the favicon (ALBERT) ~~

### Secondary Items

- can we add url params to select nodes? (most likely not)
- Sidebar title centering (it is not currently centered within the tab) (ALBERT)
- videos are squares on desktop (not exactly sure what this means)
- help page / link on desktop
- NodeGraph component - Graph zooming (ALBERT)

### Things that are dependant on input from Hannah and Raashan

- help modal - maybe - will wait to hear back from R and H

### TIME DEPENDENT ISSUES

- domain name - intersections.vitalspaces.org (to occur 6/21)

### Things to mention to H and R

- Airtable data entry: If using YouTube, you MUST enter in the embed link or else the video will not load (Ex: Artwork - Dos Corazones)
- Filters should probably be more broad to link more nodes (currently, they are very specific and do not link too many nodes)
- Description fields and images for each filter should be uploaded to get an idea of how content affects the overall layout
- Do we have any updates on whether or not we should implement a help page or leave the app as an exploratory experience?
- How do RH feel about the node graph potentially looking like a covid virii?
- RH had mentioned that videos are squares on desktop (not exactly sure what this means) - get an explanation

- Artwork images are now showing up as image links when present as a video
- This may not work as well if the uploaded bit is an audio clip
- Due to time constraints, we may want to avoid the ability to upload audio clips
