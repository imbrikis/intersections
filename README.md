# Intersections Notes

## General Overview

- We have began developing the site for mobile first
- In Figma, use the page DEVELOPMENT for reference

### Albert's notes

### David's notes

---

### Priority Items

- ~~ Vimeo videos on Videos page will not load (ALBERT) ~~
- ~~ Link Artists to collab artists (ALBERT) ~~
- ~~ When selecting Influence - History, rendered artwork images are overlapping (ALBERT) ~~
- ~~ Images sometimes do not render (see Influence desc images, might only be an issue in development) (ALBERT) ~~
- ~~ Images are overlapping in Affiliations sidebar (ALBERT) ~~
- ~~ Issue: click 'Maida Branch' node, then click 'Untitled' - the nodes are not haloing correctly - this happens across many artists without artwork (ALBERT) ~~
- ~~ Create link to node graph in mobile ham menu ~~
- ~~ Video page will not scroll down past a certain point in mobile (ALBERT) ~~
- Add links for all metadata in sidebar - collabs not showing up on Artist (ALBERT)
- Any collaborators should be listed in artist sidebar (ALBERT)
- iPhone's cannot open the site (ALBERT)

- Lightbox for viewing images when clicked (DAVID)
- Complete the How-To page (DAVID)

#### from VS meeting 5-25-2021

- ~~ artist nodes not linking by collaborators (ALBERT) ~~
- ~~ change display logic for artists that are only collaborators (ALBERT) ~~
- ~~ make sure videos from vimeo will work (ALBERT) ~~
- ~~ move image above description (artwork node) (ALBERT) ~~
- ~~ Title Line (Vital Spaces: Intersections) => Remove Logo Intersections (in bold) Vital Spaces, Maida, Warehouse 21 (W21) (ALBERT) ~~
- ~~ keep the favicon (ALBERT) ~~

### Secondary Items

- NodeGraph component - Graph zooming (ALBERT)
- Artwork image links: images should zoom in slightly when hovered, or some animation to signify hover (ALBERT)
- Node linking: filter-linked-colored lines should stay above all other lines (ALBERT)
- Node linking: it may help to halo all child nodes, even other artists, etc (ALBERT)
- display collaborators on the artist node info (ALBERT)
- Graph aspect ratio is fucky: click any dropdown and select something, open sidebar and select something else from dropdown (keep sidebar open), then collapse sidebar (ALBERT)

### TIME DEPENDENT ISSUES

- domain name - intersections.vitalspaces.org (to occur 6/21)

### Things to mention to H and R

- Filters should probably be more broad to link more nodes (currently, they are very specific and do not link too many nodes)
- Description fields and images for each filter should be uploaded to get an idea of how content affects the overall layout
