# Intersections Notes

## General Overview

- We have began developing the site for mobile first
- In Figma, use the page DEVELOPMENT for reference

### Albert's notes

### David's notes

---

### Priority Items

- iPhone's cannot open the site (ALBERT)
- Lightbox for viewing images when clicked (DAVID)
- Complete the How-To page (DAVID)

### Issues

- artist filter, morgan barnard: video links extending out of container in 1024 x 576

### Secondary Items

- NodeGraph component - Graph zooming (ALBERT)
- Artwork image links: images should zoom in slightly when hovered, or some animation to signify hover (ALBERT)
- Node linking: filter-linked-colored lines should stay above all other lines (ALBERT)
- Node linking: it may help to halo all child nodes, even other artists, etc (ALBERT)
- display collaborators on the artist node info (ALBERT)
- Graph aspect ratio is fucky: click any dropdown and select something, open sidebar and select something else from dropdown (keep sidebar open), then collapse sidebar (ALBERT)

### TIME DEPENDENT ISSUES

- domain name - intersections.vitalspaces.org (to occur 6/21)
