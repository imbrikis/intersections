# Intersections Notes

## General Overview

- We have began developing the site for mobile first
- In Figma, use the page DEVELOPMENT for reference

### Albert's notes

Personal To-do:

- Get node graph to render at same VX, VX, X and Y (it currently jumps) - still an issue - maybe not a huge one?
- Graph zooming

SCHEDULE

Monday

- ~~Node graph overlay descriptor (ALBERT)~~
- ~~Mobile hamburger menu (DAVID)~~
- Link Artists to collab artists (ALBERT)

Tuesday

- ~~Info mobile sidebar expanding/compressing animation (DAVID)~~
- ~~Mobile Sidebar expanding/compressing animation (DAVID)~~
- ~~Info mobile sidebar expanding/compressing animation (DAVID)~~
- Navigation filtering selectors (styling and updating node graph) (ALBERT)

Wednesday

- Infinite Scroll mobile navigation (DAVID)
- Mobile Sidebar expanding/compressing animation (DAVID)
- Sidebar content and media (ALBERT)
- Sidebar title centering (it is not currently centered within the tab) (ALBERT)
- ~~On Location view, when clicking 'Buffalo Thunder", the Artist field is empty and media and themes are IDs instead of names (ALBERT)~~
- ~~On Theme view: click Franklin's in Location, then click Fantasy in Theme - the theme node links are inconsistent (ALBERT)~~
- Render images in sidebar content (ALBERT)
- Add links for all metadata in sidebar (ALBERT)
- Graph aspect ratio is fucky: click any dropdown and select something, open sidebar and select something else from dropdown (keep sidebar open), then collapse sidebar (ALBERT)
- Alphabetically list items in Navbar dropdowns (ALBERT)
- Min-height the sidebar images (some of them are rendering too short) (ALBERT)
- ~~Find a way to parse double-spaces as delimiters from Airtable bios and descriptions (ALBERT)~~
- ~~Title in Artwork sidebar content is not populating (ALBERT)~~
- Data appears to be rendering multiple times during events like clicking or expanding sidebar

Thursday

- Pages: Video and about (DAVID)
- Node graph zooming (ALBERT - SECONDARY)

### David's notes

- ~~Display Link data in sidebar~~
- ~~Mobile hamburger menu (DAVID)~~
- Infinite Scroll mobile navigation (DAVID)
- Pages: Video and about (DAVID)

## To-do items

- TESTING

  - AT tables / required fields breaks all the things

- index.js page

  - the layout does not stretch to full screen on various mobile devices (maybe to do with h-screen class?)

- NodeGraph component
  - zooming
  - layout new components: zoom
