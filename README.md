## To-do items

- TESTING

  - AT tables / required fields breaks all the things

- index.js page

  - the layout does not stretch to full screen on various mobile devices (maybe to do with h-screen class?)

- NodeGraph component

  - zooming
  - layout new components: zoom
  - Data appears to be rendering multiple times when clicking a node
