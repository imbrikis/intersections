# Intersections Notes

## General Overview

- We have began developing the site for mobile first
- In Figma, use the page DEVELOPMENT for reference

### Albert's notes

### David's notes

## From VS Meeting: 5-10-2021 - Prototype Review

### Priority Items

- Add links for all metadata in sidebar - collabs not showing up on Artist (ALBERT)
- Graph aspect ratio is fucky: click any dropdown and select something, open sidebar and select something else from dropdown (keep sidebar open), then collapse sidebar (ALBERT)
- Link Artists to collab artists (ALBERT)
- When selecting Influence - History, rendered artwork images are overlapping (ALBERT)
- Lightbox for viewing images when clicked (DAVID)
- Complete the How-To page (DAVID)
- Images sometimes do not render (see Influence desc images, might only be an issue in development) (ALBERT)

#### from VS meeting 5-25-2021

- Collaborators: not showing up on artists (known bug) (ALBERT)
- display collaborators on the artist node info (ALBERT)
- change display logic for artists that are only collaborators (ALBERT
- ~~ make sure videos from vimeo will work (ALBERT) ~~
- ~~ move image above description (artwork node) (ALBERT) ~~
- Title Line (Vital Spaces: Intersections) => Remove Logo Intersections (in bold) Vital Spaces, Maida, Warehouse 21 (W21) (ALBERT)
- keep the favicon (ALBERT)

### Secondary Items

- can we add url params to select nodes? (most likely not)
- Sidebar title centering (it is not currently centered within the tab) (ALBERT)
- videos are squares on desktop (not exactly sure what this means)
- help page / link on desktop
- NodeGraph component - Graph zooming (ALBERT)

### Things that are dependant on input from Hannah and Raashan

- help modal - maybe - will wait to hear back from R and H

### TIME DEPENDENT ISSUES

- domain name - intersections.vitalspaces.org (to occur 6/21)
