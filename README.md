## From VS Meeting: 5-10-2021 - Prototype Review

### Priority Items

- NodeGraph component

  - Graph zooming
  - Data appears to be rendering multiple times when clicking a node (may no longer be an issue)

- Add links for all metadata in sidebar - collabs not showing up on Artist (ALBERT)
- Graph aspect ratio is fucky: click any dropdown and select something, open sidebar and select something else from dropdown (keep sidebar open), then collapse sidebar (ALBERT)
- Link Artists to collab artists (ALBERT)
- Filter dropdowns in mobile are not functional (DAVID)
- About page - footer does not stick to bottom of page when scrolled (ALBERT)

- Header page links should change bg color when hovered
- Fix ham menu (displays wonky when opened)

### Secondary Items

- Sidebar title centering (it is not currently centered within the tab) (ALBERT)
- When a node is clicked or filter selected, the sidebar will snap to the top of the scrollable area (works in mobile - have to work on desktop) (ALBERT)
- videos are squares on desktop (not exactly sure what this means)
- help page / link on desktop

### Tertiary Items - not a priority

- Lightbox for viewing images when clicked (ALBERT - SECONDARY)

### Things that are dependant on input from Hannah and Raashan

- help modal - maybe - will wait to hear back from R and H
- warehouse 21 and other partners -
  - Hannah is waiting on a logo from David
